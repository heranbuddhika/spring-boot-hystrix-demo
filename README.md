# spring-boot-hystrix-demo
This is a sample spring boot application to demonstrate hystrix fallback and netflix ribbon load balancing.

Main API of serviceb:  
`http://localhost:8081/servicea/greet`  
This api will directly call the serviceb and return a success message generated by serviceb. If serviceb is unavailable, hystrix will redirect to the fallback method.
